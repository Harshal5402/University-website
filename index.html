                    <p>The best aspects is that living on campus is extremely easy to go to lectures and all scheduled events, it is easy to go round and there are many things you can do such as walk around the farm etc, as well as this there is also access
                        to the bus to get to and back from Newport. The worst aspect is that there is not that much to do when things are not taking place such as there are not many communal areas for students to meet and chat, as well as this in catered
                        accommodations there is no access to an oven or hob which is kind of annoying when we have to make our own foods on weekends. Apart from that this university is great and I am loving it.</p>

                    <p>I love thé location of this hall as it is extremely close to all of my courses and so is extremely useful if I have to go back and collect something that I have forgotten. In terms of value for money I do not think it is great. It
                        is quite expensive as we are catered for Monday - Friday. However we have to provide our own meal for weekends but do not have access to a hob or oven and this is kind of annoying as you can’t make much food with just a microwave
                        and kettle so I wish there were bigger facilities. As well as this there is no common area for everyone to meet and chill together and the kitchens are extremely small, meaning that there isn’t really time for everyone to chill
                        and enjoy each others company. However, the rooms are great and if decorated then the room feels a lot more homey and feels a lot better. This place is now getting better as the days go on.</p>

        <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
        <p>In our work with students, we often encourage students to review examples of personal statements to get a sense of what a great essay might look like and <br>to just generally share a wide range of topics, structures, and writing styles so that
            they can see what’s possible when writing this essay. In this spirit, <br>we’re sharing 12 of our favorite examples from the past few years. We’ve also included analysis for what makes them outstanding <br>to (hopefully) help you uplevel your
            own essay.</p>
